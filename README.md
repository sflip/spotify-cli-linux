solving problems
----------------

When you've seen the following error:

```
No module named dbus
```

Then try to install `python-dbus`! On Ubuntu you can do it as follows:

```
sudo apt-get install python-dbus
```

If you are using another distro, then try to install `python-dbus` with your package manager.

usage with tmux
---------------

If you want to use this script in your tmux panel, you can check [tmux-plugin-spotify](https://github.com/pwittchen/tmux-plugin-spotify).

releasing
---------

configure your `~/.pypirc` file as follows:

```
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
[pypi]
username:yourusername
password:yourpassword
```

then, update version in `setup.py` file and use wrapper in a `Makefile`:

```
make dist
make release
make clean
```
